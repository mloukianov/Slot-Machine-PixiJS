## The Test 

To create a simple 3 reel slot machine using JavaScript ES5 or ES6 and the Pixi.js framework. 

We realise everyone has different levels of skill and experience when it comes to development, so we have split the test into 3 sections. If you do not have the knowledge to complete them all then that's ok, we just want to see how you approach the problem and get a feel for how you code. 

As a hint have a look for 'Slot Machine' in the search engine of your choice. If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch with your point of contact. Weâ€™ll get back to you as soon as possible. 

### Required Tasks 

* UI with a spin button and a stake selector. 
* Somewhere to display your current balance / total win / current selected stake. 
* Reels which will display a random outcome when the spin button is pressed. (You can make them appear to spin if you wish). Reels are to display 3 symbols per reel, with 3 different types of symbol (e.g. cherry, banana, melon). 
* Use of tweens / animations. 

#### Desirable Tasks 

* Connect to our simple game engine to request results and display the winnings. Full details of the API are available at https://hub.docker.com/r/coregaming/simple-slot-api/ 

#### Optional Tasks 

* Make the canvas auto fit to the current window size, so the game works on all mobile devices and desktop machines. 
* Have your game handle pixel ratio and load higher res graphics if required. 
* Sounds

**Artwork can be programmer art or anything you find around on the web.**

## Review Criteria 

We will be looking for: 

* Modular/Code organization. 
* Generic where appropriate. 
* Use of inheritance. 
* Clarity/Self documenting.
* Indenting. 
* Use of camel case. 
* Demonstrate understanding of JS scope. 
* Optimised code. 
* Use of callbacks / timers. 
* Error Handling.
